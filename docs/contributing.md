description: Set up the full OpenSchool development environment from scratch — Postgres, ThunderID, backend, and frontend.
---

This walks through setting up the full local development environment from
scratch. It's the same guide contributors use — see the project's
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for the branch/PR conventions once you're up and running.

## Prerequisites

Install the following before starting:

- [Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose
- [golang-migrate CLI](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases)
- [sqlc CLI](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/overview/install.html)
- [swag CLI](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)

Install the Go-based CLI tools:

```bash
go install github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest
go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

Add Go binaries to your `PATH` if not already done:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc
```

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openschool-org/openschool.git
cd openschool
```

## 2. Start the database

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up -d
```

This starts a PostgreSQL 17 instance on port `5432`.

## 3. Set up ThunderID

OpenSchool uses ThunderID as its identity provider. Follow the
**[ThunderID Setup](./thunderid)** guide for the full one-time setup —
starting the ThunderID container, creating the `admin`/`teacher`/
`student`/`parent` user types and roles, registering the frontend and
backend applications, and creating a test admin user. Come back here once
that's done.

## 4. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
go mod download
```

### Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your `.env` file:

```env
APP_ENV=development
PORT=8080

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=openschool
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_SSLMODE=disable

THUNDERID_JWKS_URL=https://localhost:8090/oauth2/jwks
THUNDERID_ISSUER=https://localhost:8090

THUNDERID_BASE_URL=https://localhost:8090
THUNDERID_OU_ID=<organization unit ID>

THUNDERID_CLIENT_ID=<backend Client ID from ThunderID Setup>
THUNDERID_CLIENT_SECRET=<backend Client Secret from ThunderID Setup>
THUNDERID_TOKEN_URL=https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token

# role ids from ThunderID ("Create Roles" in the ThunderID Setup guide)
THUNDERID_ROLE_STUDENT=
THUNDERID_ROLE_TEACHER=
THUNDERID_ROLE_PARENT=
THUNDERID_ROLE_ADMIN=

THUNDERID_RESOURCE=https://localhost:8090/mcp
```

See the [ThunderID Setup](./thunderid#environment-variables) guide for
exactly where each of these values comes from and common pitfalls (TLS
scheme, issuer format, auth method).

### Run database migrations

Migrations run automatically when the backend starts. To run them
manually:

```bash
migrate -path db/migrations \
  -database "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/openschool?sslmode=disable" \
  up
```

### Generate sqlc code

If you make any changes to SQL query files under `db/queries/`,
regenerate the Go code:

```bash
sqlc generate
```

This reads `sqlc.yaml` and generates typed Go code in `db/sqlc/`.

### Regenerate Swagger docs

If you make any changes to handler annotations, regenerate the OpenAPI
docs:

```bash
swag init -g cmd/api/main.go
```

The warning about no Go files in the root directory is harmless — ignore
it.

### Start the backend

```bash
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

The backend runs on `http://localhost:8080`. Swagger UI is available at
`http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` in development builds.

## 5. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your `.env` file with the values from your ThunderID frontend
application (see [ThunderID Setup](./thunderid)):

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1

VITE_THUNDERID_CLIENT_ID=<frontend Application ID>
VITE_THUNDERID_BASE_URL=https://localhost:8090
VITE_THUNDERID_SCOPES="openid profile email roles"
VITE_THUNDERID_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_THUNDERID_AFTER_SIGN_OUT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

These are read by `ThunderIDProvider` in `frontend/src/main.tsx`.

Start the frontend:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

## 6. Verify everything is running

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| Backend | http://localhost:8080 |
| Swagger UI | http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html |
| ThunderID Console | https://localhost:8090/console |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 |

## 7. Try signing in

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`.
2. You'll be redirected to the sign-in page.
3. Sign in with the test admin user you created in the
   [ThunderID Setup](./thunderid) guide.
4. You should be redirected to the home page after a successful sign-in —
   and since this is a fresh instance, straight into the
   [Setup Walkthrough](./setup).

## Development workflow

**Changes to SQL queries:**

1. Edit the relevant file under `db/queries/`.
2. Run `sqlc generate`.
3. Implement the repository method that calls the generated function.

**Changes to handlers:**

1. Add or update the handler function.
2. Add swaggo annotations above the function.
3. Run `swag init -g cmd/api/main.go`.

**Branch and PR conventions:**

- Create a feature branch from `development`: `feature/your-feature-name`.
- All PRs should target the `development` branch.
- Make sure `go build ./...` passes before submitting.
